    <h1 class="footer-line1 mi-texto">Outdoor Filmmaker and Producer. Based in Chamonix Mont Blanc, France.</h1>
    <p>Focused on capturing authentic stories from the worldâ€™s wildest places, I combine my passion for storytelling with experience in documentary filmmaking, outdoor media production, as well as studio filming and photography. My work embraces everything from rugged mountain landscapes to remote deserts and coastal regions, translating adventure and exploration into powerful visual narratives.</p>
    <p>I navigate the full production pipeline, from concept development and scriptwriting to directing and post-production. Collaborating closely with athletes, guides, and outdoor brands, bringing their stories to life through a combination of aerial drone cinematography, camera work, and dynamic action filming.</p>
    <p><strong>Drone Cinematography:</strong> Certified European drone pilot (UAS license) with over 500 hours of flight experience. Skilled at capturing dynamic aerial perspectives using a variety of drones and action scenes. Experienced in flying beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) with airspace observers and within visual line of sight (VLOS) over controlled, populated areas. Also experienced in filming hyperslapse shots, adding cinematic motion and time compression to aerial sequences.</p>
    <p><strong>Camera Operation:</strong> Proficient in long-range lenses, low-light filming, and high-action camera to capture rare moments in challenging environments. Stabilized Gimbal Ronin systems to create smooth, cinematic footage. Experienced in capturing timelapse footage, bringing dynamic stories to life as time moves forward.</p>
    <p>Equipped to operate in any terrain or climate, from icy peaks to sun drenched valleys, I rely on multiple modes of transport including skiing, climbing, cycling, hiking, and 4x4 driving to access remote locations.</p>  
    <p>I am fluent in English, native in Spanish, and conversational in French and Portuguese.</p>
    <p>Certified in wilderness first aid and knowledgeable in maritime safety, I bring both creative and practical skills to every adventure.</p>
