    <h1 class="footer-line1 espacio negrita">Outdoor Filmmaker and Producer, based in Chamonix Mont Blanc, France.</h1>
    <p class="espacio">Focused on capturing authentic stories from the worldâ€™s wildest places, I combine my passion for storytelling with experience in documentary filmmaking, outdoor media production, as well as studio filming and photography. My work embraces everything from rugged mountain landscapes to remote deserts and coastal regions, translating adventure and exploration into powerful visual narratives.</p>
    <p class="espacio">I navigate the full production pipeline, from concept development and scriptwriting to directing and post-production. Collaborating closely with athletes, guides, and outdoor brands, bringing their stories to life through a combination of aerial drone cinematography, long-lens remote camera work, gimbal stabilization, and dynamic action filming.</p>
    <p class="espacio">Drone Cinematography: Certified European drone pilot (UAS license) with over 500 hours of flight experience. Skilled at capturing dynamic aerial perspectives using a variety of drones and action scenes. FPV drones experience. Experienced in flying beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) with airspace observers and within visual line of sight (VLOS) over controlled, populated areas.</p>
    <p class="espacio">Camera Operation: Proficient in long-range lenses, remote camera setups, low-light and infrared filming, and high-action camera rigs designed to capture rare moments in challenging environments.</p>
    <p class="espacio">Stabilized Gimbal Work: Ronin systems to create smooth, cinematic footage both on foot and from vehicles. </p>
    <p class="espacio">In addition, I work confidently with timelapses, hyperlapse drone shots, bringing diverse storytelling techniques to every project.</p>
    <p class="espacio">Equipped to operate in any terrain or climate, from icy peaks to sun drenched valleys, I rely on multiple modes of transport including skiing, climbing, cycling, hiking, and 4x4 driving to access remote locations. I am fluent in English, native in Spanish, and conversational in French and Portuguese.</p>
    <p class="espacio">Certified in wilderness first aid and knowledgeable in maritime safety, I bring both creative and practical skills to every adventure.</p>
